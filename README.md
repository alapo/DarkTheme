# DarkTheme
This project is my attempt at trying to modify an RStudio theme to have the following features I have asked this as a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37635237/editing-r-studio-theme-in-cache-css-theme-file-ace-editor/54137279#54137279)
and proposed it as a feature within RStudio. 


# TO DO

1) Upload Photoshopped pictures of what I am trying to do 
2) Upload Pictures from post I made on Feature Request (github\rstudio)

## Guide
 1. Start by right clicking on RStudio and then clicking "Inspect"
 2. Once this is done the Web Inspector will open and you can scroll down to find the .css file link
 3. From here edit the .css to your liking. I personally like adding some comments so I understand what I am editing.
    a. To do this I usually use the color code `#f0f` which is a bright purple and makes it easy to see what I am editing.
