# DarkTheme
This project is my attempt at trying to modify an RStudio theme to have the following features I have asked this as a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37635237/editing-r-studio-theme-in-cache-css-theme-file-ace-editor/54137279#54137279)
and proposed it as a feature within RStudio. 


# TO DO

1) Upload Photoshopped pictures of what I am trying to do 
2) Upload Pictures from post I made on Feature Request (github\rstudio)
